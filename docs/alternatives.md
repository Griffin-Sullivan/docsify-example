# Alternatives to Docsify
## Jekyll
Jekyll is one of the first and most popular SSGs that runs off of Ruby as its base programming language. Jekyll takes in Markdown, Liquid, HTML, and CSS and is then able to generate a static site from these inputs. It's most commmon use case is for creating blogs.

## 11ty
Eleventy is very similar to Jekyll as it is also an SSG, but it instead is built off of Javascript and uses NodeJS to install just like Docsify. However, 11ty works with tons of template languages when compared to Jekyll. It's still a pretty new SSG, but is building widespread adoption in the market.

## Read the Docs
Read the Docs is probably the most similar alternative to Docsify in terms of use cases as it is also mainly built for creating sites for documentation. Read the Docs is not a SSG though, as it is more of a platform that allows people to host their documentation on the site for free. It is similar as it is mostly made for Markdown, but can accept other formats like PDF and HTML.

## Why use Docsify?
If you're taking an SSG approach to creating a documentation-like website then Docsify is the perfect solution. We aren't looking to host the site on Read the Docs, and we want to be able to have more control and customization over the site. On top of this, most people already have NodeJS, so its very simple to get started. Instead of writing a bunch of HTML or configuring Jekyll or 11ty, you can run a few commands and have a basic site up and going. Then all you have to do is add some configuration if you want to in the index.html file and then start writing your Markdown files. There's also tons of plugins and APIs you can integrate into your site, which is easier than doing everything from scratch.
