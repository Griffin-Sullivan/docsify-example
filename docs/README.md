# What is Docsify? ![](docsify.png)
## Yeah what's that?
Hello there! This is a standard Docsify website. Docsify is Static Site Generator (SSG) that loads and parses Markdown files and displays them as a website. What makes Docsify unique is that it generates your documentation without ever making static html files
